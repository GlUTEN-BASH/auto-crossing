# Functions:

Autocraft - Spamming A button. Just select the recipe you need and run the script.

Autopick - Holding LS down and spamming Y. Great for picking up items in line.

Cube Autopick - move by zigzag by 8x8 cube and picking up everything. Unstable, but working.

Star Catch - Spamming A with more delay than Autocraft. Really great for AFK in big starfall.

Stone Break - Digging a hole trap and breaking the stone. For proper use, please stand in this position before running:

```
  You
(1 gap)
 Stone
```
Also you need to face to Horth while standing.

Tree pick - Spamming A and picking up items on each side in loop.

Inv sell - Selling the whole inventory. Useful when you need to sell ALL turnips in your inventory, but sometimes you miss one stack.
